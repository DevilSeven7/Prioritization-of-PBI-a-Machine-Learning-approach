# Prioritization of Product Backlog Items (PBI), a Machine Learning approach
This notebook explores the possibility of using _machine learning_ to prioritize the PBIs of the product backlog  used in Scrum. It is a job for the _IT Project Management_ course of my master's degree course in Computational Intelligence and Data Analytics. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate a possible application, and the related consequences, of machine learning in _project management_.

The data used was created from scratch by me, given the impossibility to find them.
